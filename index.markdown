For over two years I have meticulously captured my epilepsy data to find how it correlates to medication and post-operative state. [Here's a link](/data) to all of the data.

On November 27th 2024 I had a left selective [amygdalohippocampectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalohippocampectomy) interstitial thermal laser ablation ([LiTT](https://www.epilepsy.com/treatment/surgery/types/litt-thermal-ablation)) surgery to remove the entirety of my left hippocampus through an innovative procedure performed by [Dr. Vivek Buch](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vivek-buch) at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu) in Palo Alto.

* **Causation**: [Meningococcal](meningococcal) [meningitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis) and [encephalitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis) when I was twenty years old is the likely cause. Techniques were naturally developed via holistic learning to compensate for the loss of memory. Those techniques resulted in high educational and career success leading to unawareness of the medical condition.
* **Pre-Surgery State**: Deep investigation by [Dr. Sharam Amina](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/shahramamina) and [Dr. Derek Yecies](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/derekyecies) at Kaiser Permanente in Redwood City, California showed the left hippocampus was already non-functional. Dr. Yecies performed an [sEEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoelectroencephalography) surgery whose results showed the left hippocampus was continuously misfiring. A [Wada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wada_test) test was performed showing the right hippocampus was compensating for the lack of function in the left hippocampus. Memory tests showed a non-functional left hippocampus, with the right hippocampus compensating adequately.
* **Surgery**: Surgery was performed at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu) by [Dr. Vivek Buch](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vivek-buch). You can listen to Dr. Buch explaining this surgery via this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-nRUMbs2kY). A newer variation of this surgery was performed via a single incision that targeted the entire hippocampus by re-inserting the laser three separate times, only the fifth time this procedure has been performed on the planet. The procedure took Dr. Buch a total of nine hours followed by an MRI scan.
* **Post-Surgery State**: Today marks only five days since the surgery with no remarkable difference in cognitive function or short-term memory. This result aligns with what both [Dr. Sharam Amina](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/shahramamina) and [Dr. Derek Yecies](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/derekyecies) expected given their research and the outcome of [Dr. Vivek Buch's](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vivek-buch) successful surgery. 

### **Kieran's Short-Term Memory**

This is a common topic. Deep study by Kaiser Permanente on multiple fronts showed my short-term memory is being controlled by my right hippocampus. The left hippocampus was non-functional per the Wada test, with the right hippocampus scoring 100% on memory tests. The sEEG showed the left hippocampus was misfiring non-stop both whilst conscious and even more so during sleep.

The results from these tests indicated there would be no impact on short-term memory post-surgery, and studies also show there can be an _increase_ in verbal memory after surgery. The tests revealed techniques being utilized to remember details and a general high IQ. Short-term memory was also found to be low-scoring per expectations.

In short, I have been using compensatory techniques for the last eighteen years to manage short-term memory. The success of this could be reflected in my career where today I operate as a Senior Engineer at Apple's global headquarters, Apple Park.

### **Seizure Medication vs. Seizures**

For over two years I meticuously captured seizure and medication data, using the results to guide my future care. The data showed successes of medications in addition to the necessity of surgery given it was shown to be refractory epilepsy.

The graph below correlates three data points; time (x-axis), medication dosage (y-axis), and seizure count (also y-axis). The x-axis reprents every single day for more than two years with each entry capturing the types and dosages of medications as well as the number of seizures on that given day. Combining these three data sets directly reflects the efficacy of each medication over time, with Clobazam (a powerful benzodiazepine) being the most effective.
        
 The epilepsy type is refractory LTLE (Left [Temporal Lobe Epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe_epilepsy)) with the graph showing the 'honeymoon period' of the Clobazam as seizures begun to increase after some time. The primary seizure type is absence seizures with high-impacting aphasia (inability to communicate entirely). Four entries represent tonic clonic seizures, and two out of these hundreds of entries were cluster seizures (unmarked).
