Why did I create this data-driven website? To help destigmatize epilepsy and educate those about this condition. For the last two years I have meticulously captured my epilepsy data to find how it correlates to medication and potential other factors. 

So with that, let me tell you my story.

## Origins

On December 1st 2006 I awoke at 3am in my small apartment in [Reading, England](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Reading,%20England&auid=10553136414495201411&ll=51.456886,-0.970136&lsp=6489&q=Reading) whilst I was on my university internship working for [Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Digital). I immediately reached for my phone and called the emergency services. "What's the nature of your emergency?" they asked, to which I answered "I don't know." The next question was so unsettling it wrenched my gut, sending me into panic mode. "What's your name?" I had absolutely no idea what my name was.

Forty-five minutes into the phone call I was screaming for help at cars in the street of Castle Hill as they drove around me in bewilderment. The emergency services still knew nothing, not where I lived, my name, or even what the problem was. An ambulance slowly drove up to me without its lights on and took my phone from me - "we've got him". But that phone call had never found me. Some passerby at 3:45am, also bewildered, had called up the emergency services in fear of approaching me; the savior I never met.

I distinctly recall their first question as I got into the back of the ambulance. "What drugs have you taken tonight?" One minute later I stopped breathing as the paramedics rushed to resusitate me. The timing of this event still lives deep inside of me. Call it what you will, a miracle, good luck, or some divine intervention, but I sure as heck wouldn't be here today had they arrived just a couple of minutes later.

Two days later I awoke on a life support machine. The doctors had taken blood tests and performed many scans. Completely clear of drugs and alcohol they relied upon my [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) scan showing how extremely swollen my brain and its lining was. My brain could no longer tell my body how to breath. Several days later I had a lumbar puncture confirming the issue; [meningococcal meningitis](https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/index.html) and [encephalitis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/encephalitis#:~:text=Encephalitis%20is%20inflammation%20of%20the,light%2C%20mental%20confusion%20and%20seizures.), the exact same illness that had killed my brother's best friend. Not only was it a miracle that I had survived, but I had survived with no obvious issues later on.

This event sparked something deep inside of me that I truly believe has been the reason for the success I've had in life. For whatever barrier that stood in my way I would forevermore stare at it in the face and say "Not today you don't." It taught me two invaluable lessons, that life sure as hell is short so milk the hell out of it, and that you're truly able to overcome whatever may stand in your way.

Just over a year later I graduated with top marks from university, and shortly thereafter married the love of my life, the woman who would turn me into a man.

But that's not the end to this story.

## Concrete Beginnings

It's February 2020 and I had become sick. Very sick. Two weeks into this sickness I scheduled an e-visit with a physician whilst I was now living in Silicon Valley, California. "You'll improve now you're two weeks into this" was the response. The next day I started coughing up blood. My wife took me to the hospital where they x-rayed my chest; I had bilateral pneumonia. The sickness took me almost a year to recover from. Without any COVID tests available at the time it was impossible to know. Quite some time later a doctor told me to assume it was COVID given it wasn't flu or anything else to cause such an issue.

Now then, I didn't tell another part to this whole story which is where the data truly comes from, and here's the part you the reader experience your own bewilderment. On the last day of November in 2006 I was on a dark bus ride home from work. Suddenly I was transported to an alien world where there was no up or down, just odd creatures living on giant rocks full of holes, floating around a green-like, empty space close to one another. During this time I was no longer present on Earth. I never told anyone for fear of judgement, and outside of these journeys there was nothing wrong with me. These experiences occurred for years, and I truly wanted to experience them more in my journey of discovery to some outer-realm.

Many years later these transportations no longer happened, instead replaced with an absence. I lost my ability to speak and stared into space as if I were daydreaming. After the bout of COVID in 2020 these became a lot worse to the point my wife started secretly recording me, asking questions knowing I was completely unable to respond. After showing me those videos I went to see my physician.

I have the feeling my physician gave me a dubious look of suspicion given that during our appointment I blanked out like I was describing to her. Just two days later she diagnosed me with [mesial temporal sclerosis](https://www.epilepsy.com/causes/structural/mesial-temporal-sclerosis) after the results from my MRI came back, and shortly thereafter a neurologist confirmed her diagnosis. I would then spend the next couple of years experimenting with a cocktail of drugs, turning my life upside-down as I battled with the severity of their side effects.

In early 2024 I had a [stereoelectroencephalography](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17457-seeg-test) (sEEG) and within twenty-four hours I had ten seizures. My brainwave activity was off the charts, continuously errupting and alerting the nurses to some never-ending seizure. Throughout the next forty-eight hours nurses would wake me up in the middle of the night thinking I was actively seizing. The data was bad.

## Reflection

Epilepsy is a strange condition felt with judgement and suspicion. From an outside perspective you're doing just fine but the internal struggle is felt daily. The physiological side effects from a concuction of drugs that even scientists don't understand, all the way to the psychological struggle in anticipation for your next seizure and the damage it causes. There can be no true empathy without first-hand insights.

And so instead I turn to data, the irrefutable knowledge to one's self doubt that their condition is indeed real. For the last two years I've been recording every seizure I've had along with the medications I've been taking. There are most definitely correlations between the two, and for each individual they have their own personalized experience of each of these. Comparing two individuals' responses to epilepsy medication is like comparing apples to oranges, a futile attempt.

## Data

Seizures come in all shapes and sizes and each epileptic has their own unique experience. I suffer from aphasia during my seizures along with my memory being pulled from its socket. When you speak to me I can't understand you, I cannot speak myself, and I can no longer read or write. Atop of this I'm utterly confused. A tick in the box of "seizure" simply means this precise experience, but they do come in flavors of severity. I've had cluster seizures and tonic clonics which I've independently recorded in the data.
