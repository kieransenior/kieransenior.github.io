Why did I create this data-driven website? To help destigmatize epilepsy and educate those about this condition. For the last two years I have meticulously captured my epilepsy data to find how it correlates to medication and potential other factors. 

So with that, let me tell you my story.

## Origins

On December 1st 2006 I awoke at 3am in my small apartment in [Reading, England](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Reading,%20England&auid=10553136414495201411&ll=51.456886,-0.970136&lsp=6489&q=Reading) whilst I was on my university internship working for [Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Digital). I immediately reached for my phone and called the emergency services. "What's the nature of your emergency?" they asked, to which I answered "I don't know." The next question was so unsettling it sent me into panic mode. "What's your name?" I had absolutely no idea what my name was.

Forty-five minutes into the phone call I was screaming for help at cars in the street of Castle Hill as they drove around me in bewilderment. The emergency services still knew nothing, not where I lived, my name, or even what the problem was. An ambulance slowly drove up to me without its lights on and took my phone from me. "We've got him." But that phone call had never found me. Some passerby at 3:45am, also bewildered, had called up the emergency services in fear of approaching me; the savior I never met.

I distinctly recall their first question as I got into the back of the ambulance. "What drugs have you taken tonight?" One minute later I stopped breathing as the paramedics rushed to resuscitate me. The timing of this event still lives deep inside of me. Call it what you will, a miracle, good luck, or some divine intervention, but I sure as heck wouldn't be here today had they arrived just a couple of minutes later.

Two days later I awoke on a life support machine. The doctors had taken blood tests and performed many scans. Completely clear of drugs and alcohol they relied upon my [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) scan showing how extremely swollen my brain and its lining was. My brain could no longer tell my body how to breath. Several days later I had a [lumbar puncture](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumbar-puncture/about/pac-20394631#:~:text=A%20lumbar%20puncture%20can%20help,Barre%20syndrome%20and%20multiple%20sclerosis.) confirming the issue; [meningococcal meningitis](https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/index.html) and [encephalitis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/encephalitis#:~:text=Encephalitis%20is%20inflammation%20of%20the,light%2C%20mental%20confusion%20and%20seizures.), the exact same illness that had killed my brother's best friend. Not only was it a miracle that I had survived, but I had survived with no obvious issues later on.

Just over a year later I graduated from university, and shortly thereafter married the love of my life, the woman who would turn me into a man.

But that's not the end to this story.

## Concrete Beginnings

Now then, I didn't tell another part to this whole story, and here's the part you the reader experience your own bewilderment. On the last day of November in 2006 I was on a bus ride home from work. Suddenly I was transported to an alien world where there was no up or down, just odd creatures living on giant rocks full of holes, floating around a green-like, empty space close to one another. During this time I was no longer present on Earth. I never told anyone for fear of judgement, and outside of these journeys there was nothing wrong with me. These experiences occurred for years, and I wanted to experience them more in my journey of discovery to this outer-realm.

Many years later these transportations no longer happened, instead replaced with an absence. I lost my ability to speak and stared into space as if I were daydreaming. After my bout of COVID in 2020 these became a lot worse to the point my wife started secretly recording me, asking questions knowing I was completely unable to respond. After showing me those videos I went to see my physician.

I have a feeling my physician gave me a dubious look of suspicion given that during our appointment I blanked out, unable to speak like I had been describing. Just two days later I was diagnosed with [mesial temporal sclerosis](https://www.epilepsy.com/causes/structural/mesial-temporal-sclerosis) after the results from my MRI came back, and shortly thereafter a neurologist confirmed the diagnosis. I would then spend the next couple of years experimenting with a cocktail of drugs, turning my life upside-down as I battled with the severity of their side effects.

In early 2024 I had a [stereoelectroencephalography](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17457-seeg-test) (sEEG) and within twenty-four hours I had ten seizures. My brainwave activity was off the charts, continuously erupting and alerting the nurses to some never-ending seizure. Throughout the next forty-eight hours nurses would wake me up in the middle of the night thinking I was actively seizing. The data was bad.

## The Future and Reflection

It's both bleak and optimistic. Between the data I recorded and the amazing healthcare I've received there's a tight-rope of a future. On the one hand it could go terribly wrong, but given what we've learned it paves the way towards a balanced approach for my health. Thankfully I've got some of the world's best neurosurgeons at hand, but the variability in outcome is so vast there are no guarantees. Soon I will receive [Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LiTT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-nRUMbs2kY) to remove my left [hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus), a part of your brain you're using right now to recall details about this story I've written.

If you'd have met me in real life you'd have no idea there was anything wrong with me (unless you were the lucky department where I work witnessing me seizing whilst unconscious on the floor). Epilepsy is a strange condition felt with judgement and suspicion. From an outside perspective you're doing just fine but the internal struggle is felt daily. The physiological side effects from a concuction of drugs that even scientists don't understand, all the way to the psychological struggle in anticipation for your next seizure and the damage it causes.

And so I turn to data, the irrefutable knowledge to one's self doubt that their condition is indeed real. For the last two years I've been recording every seizure I've had along with the medications I've been taking. There are most definitely correlations between the two, and for each individual they have their own personalized experience to each of these. Comparing two individuals' responses to epilepsy medication is like comparing apples to oranges, a futile attempt.

If you have epilepsy I wish you the best, and please do feel free to contact me.

Thanks for reading.

Kieran.
