On November 27th 2024 I had a _left_ selective [amygdalohippocampectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalohippocampectomy) surgery via Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ([LiTT](https://www.epilepsy.com/treatment/surgery/types/litt-thermal-ablation)) to ablate (destroy) the entirety of my left hippocampus and amygdala through an innovative procedure performed by [Dr. Vivek Buch](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vivek-buch) at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu) in Palo Alto. I was the fifth person to ever have the entire hippocampus and amygdala ablated with <ins>_three trajectories in a single procedure_</ins>.

For over two years I meticulously captured my epilepsy data whose results were leveraged for the eventual destruction of my left hippocampus and amygdala. This data capture is used to discover how it correlates with medication, pre-operative state, and post-operative state. [Here's a link](/data) to all of the data. The epilepsy type is refractory left [temporal lobe epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe_epilepsy) (LTLE). 



This website is used to help both inform current epileptic patients and provide data and insights for professionals in medicine. Do feel free to contact me [via email](mailto:kieransenior@icloud.com) for further information.

| **Causation** |
| [Meningococcal](meningococcal) [meningitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis) and [encephalitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis) when I was twenty years old is either the cause itself or the catalyst for pre-existing epilepsy. We will never know due to the lack of MRI scans prior to the meningitis. | 
| **Pre-Surgery** |
| Deep investigation by [Dr. Sharam Amina](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/shahramamina) and [Dr. Derek Yecies](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/derekyecies) at Kaiser Permanente in Redwood City, California showed the left hippocampus was already non-functional. Dr. Yecies performed an [sEEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoelectroencephalography) surgery whose results showed the left hippocampus was *continuously* misfiring. A [Wada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wada_test) test was performed showing the right hippocampus was compensating for the lack of function in the left hippocampus. Memory tests showed a non-functional left hippocampus, with the right hippocampus compensating adequately. |
| **Surgery** |
| Surgery was performed at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu) by [Dr. Vivek Buch](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vivek-buch). You can listen to Dr. Buch explaining this surgery via this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-nRUMbs2kY). I was the fifth patient on the planet to have a newer variation of this surgery performed that ablates the _entire_ hippocampus and amygdala, requiring three re-entries. The procedure took Dr. Buch a total of nine hours followed by an MRI scan. |
| **Post-Surgery** |
| No remarkable difference in cognitive function. Verbal memory is influenced per expectations i.e. reading a book and retaining information. This is mitigated for via audiobooks. This result aligns with what both [Dr. Sharam Amina](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/shahramamina) and [Dr. Derek Yecies](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/derekyecies) expected given their research in addition to the outcome of [Dr. Vivek Buch's](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/vivek-buch) successful surgery.  |

### **Common Post-Surgery Questions**

| **Were you awake during the surgery?** |
| This is the most common question I've been asked. **No**. I was _not_ awake during the surgery. Brain surgery videos watched online show the patient awake _because_ the patient is awake, making the surgery more interesting. Do you want to watch a nine hour surgery with a patient asleep? I would assume you would not! |
| **Has your short-term memory been affected?** |
| Deep study by Kaiser Permanente on multiple fronts showed my short-term memory is being controlled by my right hippocampus. The left hippocampus was barely functional per the Wada test, with the right hippocampus scoring 100% on memory tests. The sEEG showed the left hippocampus was misfiring non-stop both whilst conscious and even more so during sleep.<br /><br />The results from these tests indicated there would be no major impact on short-term memory post-surgery, and studies also show there can be an _increase_ in verbal memory after surgery. The tests revealed techniques being utilized to remember details and a general high IQ. Short-term memory was found to be low-scoring per expectations. |
| **What post-surgery side effects were there?** |
| *Recalling names of people and other miscellaneous things*: I know precisely who/what they are, I just cannot name them. Once I've named them once, or once I've struggled to name them and had a sleep on it, I then recall what they are without issue. This issue continues three months after the surgery. (March 3rd, 2025). Your typical observant will jokingly say how that's just a result of aging but alas, that's not the case here.<br /><br />*Repeating words/statements:* If I'm typing a paragraph out I'll repeat series of words. I am aware that I've done this once I've finished writing and go back to correct it. I can also repeat things during conversations, although less common.<br /><br />*Improved mood:* The psychological aspects of the surgery are difficult to pinpoint to the physiological changes that have occurred of course. |
| **How long did it take to recover?** |
| I felt totally back to normal after almost two weeks and went back to work after just one and-a-half weeks. Interestingly, the worst side effect was being on life support for ten hours which causes a sore throat and ulcers on the tongue. |
| **Where are the incisions/scars?** |
| Compared to the sEEG, the LiTT surgery to destroy your brain matter requires a tiny hole to insert the device without the need to cut any hair. The noticeable marks on your head are where the frame needs to keep your head completely still requiring tremendous force. |

### **Core Medical Team**

List ordered by dates met. This list does not include the very large team of doctors, nurses, and assistants whom all contributed to the successful outcome of both treatment and surgery.

| Doctor | Title |
| -------- | -------- |
| [Dr. Sharam Amina](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/shahramamina) | Epileptologist, Kaiser Permanente |
| [Dr. Derek Yecies](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/derekyecies) | Neurosurgeon, Kaiser Permanente |
| [Dr. Paul McGeoch](https://profiles.stanford.edu/paul-mcgeoch) | Clinical Instructor, Neurosurgery, Stanford |
| [Dr. Vivek Buch](https://profiles.stanford.edu/vivek-buch) | Assistant Professor of Neurosurgeory, Stanford |

### **Seizure Medication vs. Seizures**

The graph below correlates three data points; time in months (x-axis), medication dosage (y-axis), and seizure count via the line (also y-axis). The x-axis reprents each month for more than two years with each entry capturing the types and dosages of medications as well as the number of seizures in that month. Combining these three data sets directly reflects the efficacy of each medication over time, with [Clobazam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobazam) (a powerful benzodiazepine) being the most effective. The primary seizure type is absence seizures with high-impacting aphasia (inability to communicate entirely). Four entries represent tonic clonic seizures, and two out of these hundreds of entries were cluster seizures (unmarked) lasting fifteen minutes.

Data is no longer being recorded due to a successful surgery (updated on June 7th, 2025).
