Why did I create this data-driven website? To help destigmatize epilepsy and educate those about this condition. For the last two years I have meticulously captured my epilepsy data to find how it correlates to medication and potential other factors. Read the [about page](/about) to read more about this.

### **Seizure Medication vs. Seizures**

The graph below correlates three data points; time (x-axis), medication dosage (y-axis), and seizure count (also y-axis). The x-axis reprents every single day for more than two years with each entry capturing the types and dosages of medications as well as the number of seizures on that given day. Combining these three data sets directly reflects the efficacy of each medication over time, with Clobazam (a powerful benzodiazepine) being the most effective.
        
 The epilepsy type is refractory LTLE (Left [Temporal Lobe Epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe_epilepsy)) with the graph showing the 'honeymoon period' of the Clobazam as seizures begun to increase after some time. The primary seizure type is absence seizures with high-impacting aphasia (inability to communicate entirely). Four entries represent tonic clonic seizures, and two out of these hundreds of entries were cluster seizures (unmarked). The upcoming course of treatment will be LiTT surgery ([Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy](https://www.epilepsy.com/treatment/surgery/types/litt-thermal-ablation)) to remove/destroy the left hippocampus.
